* [Link on task (click on it)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1buO0R0ne5T4uJnbpurlUoEFWO3MJ__VL/view?usp=sharing)

* Ruby version is 3.3.2, rails version is 7.1.3

* It works with sqlite3 (guess you have it already install). I installed it for convenience, because you don't need to make any special settings (Try to keep it simple)

* To make it work run `buldle install`, `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`

* I write seed file so you could run it with `rails db:seed`

I wrote the application in accordance with the criteria provided in the assignment. Since the basic logic was not defined and the task did not require the implementation of controllers, I tried to write abstractly. We will be able to discuss the details at the interview.
